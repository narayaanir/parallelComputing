Java Files for Parallel Computing using Parallel Java Library


This folder contains various files for parallel programming using Java and CUDA. 
It should be noted that it depends on a Parallel Java Library created by Prof. Alan Kaminsky 
of Rochester Institute of Technology. To compile and execute the files successfully, you must use
the Java archive containing the library.
